# MasterPlan — Crypto Swing Analysis Suite

## 1. Executive Summary
Goal: Decide if BTC/ETH swings are *sustained* (fundamental) or *transient* (noise) and size hedges automatically.
Core output: Swing Sustainability Score ∈ [0, 1] (≥ 0.7 heavy hedge, ≤ 0.3 light hedge).
Edge: Fuse sentiment + order-book liquidity + on-chain flows; loop budget ≤ 5 s.

| Neutral & negative Twitter sentiment moves intraday liquidity and volatility in BTC/ETH/LTC/XRP | [MDPI Data **10(4):50** (2025)](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/10/4/50) | Confirms sentiment is tied to micro-moves our desk cares about |
| Sentiment-enriched LSTM beats price-only models (MAE ↓18%) | [BDCC **7(3):137** (2023)](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/7/3/137) | Shows adding NLP signal can improve short-horizon prediction |
| Large-language-model ensembles (FinBERT + GPT-4) hit 86% directional accuracy but require careful fine-tuning | [BDCC **8(6):63** (2024)](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/8/6/63) | Practical ceiling on model edge, highlights tuning cost |
| Twitter bot manipulation inflates positive sentiment & volume | [Finance Research Letters **61** (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612322001234) | Underscores need for bot filtering before scoring |
| Bibliometric review finds sentiment often lags price in crypto hype cycles | [IJFS **13(2):87** (2025)](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/13/2/87) | Momentum trades on raw sentiment can whipsaw – need lag/reversal features |
| Influencer tweets (e.g., Musk) cause short-lived spikes, reversion within 60 m | [Technol. Forecasting & Soc. Change **186** (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2022.122164) | Supports down-weighting celebrity bursts |

## 3. Key Insights at-a-Glance
1. **Sentiment is tradable but weak** – peer studies peg standalone accuracy ~55-60%. Edge comes when fused with order-book + on-chain flow (Insight #1).
2. **Noise is structural** – bots, shill threads, and influencer pumps distort raw feeds (Insight #2). Any production system must score *clean* tweets only.
3. **Lag cuts both ways** – positive sentiment typically *lags* major up-moves (risk of buying tops) while neutral/negative moves liquidity contemporaneously (Insight #3).
4. **Model complexity tops out fast** – ensembles of FinBERT/GPT-4 reach ~86% hit-rate; beyond that, diminishing returns vs compute (Insight #4).
5. **Liquidity is king** – the only sentiment feature that consistently correlates with PnL is its impact on depth/spread, not on direction (Insight #5).
6. **Human override still needed** – research warns of manipulation risk on extreme scores; plan keeps manual sign-off for Score <0.1 or >0.9 (Insight #6).

## 4. Gap Analysis — Alignment vs Expert Wisdom
| Plan Component | Expert Validation | Tuning required |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Sentiment scraper → ML classifier | Supported (Data 2025, BDCC 2023) | Add bot filter + influencer down-weight (Insights 2, 6) |
| Score threshold 0.7 / 0.3 | No academic consensus | Walk-forward optimise on 2021-24 data |
| Liquidity feature integration | Strong evidence (Insight 5) | Include depth/spread delta |
| 5 s latency budget | Uncontested | Keep async I/O + cache |
| Fully automated hedging | Experts flag manipulation (Insight 6) | Retain human check on extreme scores |

## 5. Revised High-Level Approach (no timeline)
1. **Data Ingestion** — Async pull: tweets (with Botometer), news headlines, on-chain, order-book snapshots.
2. **Cleaning & Feature Layer** — Remove bots, detect sarcasm, compute lagged sentiment windows, liquidity deltas.
3. **Model Ensemble** — XGBoost (tabular) + FinBERT (text) + rule-based lag trigger; majority vote.
4. **Score & Hedge Engine** — Map score to hedge size; override if manipulation risk high.
5. **Continuous Evaluation** — Walk-forward validation; Sharpe & drawdown monitor; alert on drift.

## 6. Open Questions for the Team
• Acceptable false-hedge cost vs missed-hedge cost?  
• Minimum liquidity threshold to act?  
• Regulatory constraints on scraping volume?  
• Integration point with existing risk dashboard?

*Evidence drives design; expand scope only when new data raises edge.*
