## 📝 Why Archive?

These documents were archived because they:
1. **Completed their purpose** - Planning docs after implementation
2. **One-time use** - Setup guides for specific milestones
3. **Reference material** - Research that's valuable but not daily-use
4. **Reduced confusion** - Too many docs made it hard to find current info
